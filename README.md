# Template repo for CA282 RPN calculator

## Prerequisites

This is an npm project.  It depends upon a number of npm modules.

To install the necessary npm modules, use:

    $ npm install

## Task

Your task is as follows:

1. Extend the implementation in `index.js` such that it implements the RPN-calculator API described in
   static/README.md.
2. Ensure `make test` succeeds.
3. Complete the `.gitlab-ci.yml` CI config files such that the tests are run (and pass!) when you push
   your work to GitLab.
