This is an npm project.  It depends upon a number of npm modules.

To install the necessary npm modules, use:

    $ npm install

## Task 1

Extend the implementation in `index.js` such that it implements the RPN-calculator API described in static/README.md.

Ensure that `make rpn` (which runs the RPN calculator rests) succeeds.


## Task 2

Do not proceed to this task until you have successfully completed task 1.

Complete the `.gitlab-ci.yml` CI config files such that the `random` **and** `rpn` tests
are run (and pass!) when you push your work to GitLab.

Check under "CI/CD" / "Jobs" on GitLab.  Fix any issues which arise.
